Python translation of Michael Porter's KRAKEN (not KRAKENC).

An alternative implementation,which provided an internal wave mode equation solver using the same numerical methods, as Richard Evans FORTRAN model WAVE, is found in 
This is on an archived branch of the code called rev1_archive. 

The code is provided "as is", with no guarantees of correctness. When in doubt, compare to KRAKEN and KRAKENC.
Comparisons for a number of test environments are provided in tests/.
